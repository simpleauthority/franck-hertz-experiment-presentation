        <h3>So did I succeed?</h3>
        <p>For the first goal of showing that atoms can only accept quantized energy amounts, I did succeed. Recalling the graph, we observed current peaking, dipping, and then peaking again as we increased our accelerating voltage.</p>
        <p>Increasing the accelerating voltage is akin to speeding up the electrons, or giving them more kinetic energy. As a result, we see the mercury atoms accepting discrete amounts of that kinetic energy (the peaks), not accepting it (the dips) until a new multiple of the discrete amount is met where it peaks again.</p>

        <h3>So did I succeed?</h3>
        <p>As for finding the first excitation value of mercury, I mostly succeeded. Strictly going by the values found, since they were not the same each time, the first excitation energy (the first peak-to-peak measurement) was found to be $4.5V$.</p>
        <p>As theory is $4.9V$, my percent difference for the first excitation energy is $\frac{4.5-4.9}{4.5}*100 = -8.2$%. However, over all the measurements, the average excitation energy was found to be $4.9V$. In this case, my result matches theory exactly.</p>

            <li class="fragment"><strong>Overheating filament.</strong> As I was nearing the end of my experiment, I noticed my numbers looked somewhat odd. I checked the electrometer again and noticed a current much higher than it should have been. In my case, the filament was potentially overheating, possibly skewing data results slightly. I had to end my experiment there.</li>

        <ul>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Data collection inconsistencies.</strong> The precise electrical equipment had to be constantly zero-checked while working. It is possible this was not always done in the best way, losing accuracy.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Data recording inconsistencies.</strong> Viewing the data collected by the equipment over the internet was difficult at best, and there is a good chance some numbers were not recorded correctly.</li>
