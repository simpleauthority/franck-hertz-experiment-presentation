            <h4>What is the Franck-Hertz Experiment?</h4>
            <div class="mt-20"></div>
            <p>On April 24, 1914, James Franck (left) and Gustav Hertz (right) presented a groundbreaking research paper to the German Physical Society that helped to prove the quantum nature of atoms.</p>

            <p>The main idea of the experiment was to show that when an electron collides with an atom (a mercury atom in our case), it is only possible for the electron to lose (and therefore for the atom to gain) a specific, or quantized, amount of energy.</p>
            <p class="fragment">This was a huge discovery and step forward for Physics. As a result, Franck and Hertz were awarded the 1925 Nobel Prize in Physics "for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom" (The Nobel Foundation).</p>
            <p class="fragment">That experiment is what we call today the Franck-Hertz Experiment.</p>
